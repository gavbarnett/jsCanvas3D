# jsCanvas3D

https://gavbarnett.github.io/jsCanvas3D/index.html
A proof of concept (messing around) with creating a 3D first person free roaming simulation/game, and procedural map gen. All in js using only a basic canvas.


Move around - WASD

Tilt head (up and down) - up/down arrows

Gun - does nothing :-), dont panic, no zomies either!

Top left corner shows stats and a little white circle thing acts as a kind of mini-map showing altitude (white high, black low)
